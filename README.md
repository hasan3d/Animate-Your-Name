# Animate Your Name

I wrote this JavaScript as a part of the project assigned by [Codecademy] (https://www.codecademy.com).
In order to accomplish this project i had to use JavaScript library such as jQuery, alphabet.js etc.

I have extended the original project and added some extra JavaScript with regular expression. So, when a user click on the view project, it will prompt for use first and last name. If the user only enters his/her first or last name it will throw an error and ask user to enter full name. I have written this program in a way that it will only accept a person's full name. If the person's full name is too long then they can enter their initial and surname.
