# Animate Your Name

I wrote this JavaScript as a part of the project assigned by Codecademy(https://www.codecademy.com).
In order to accomplish this project i had to use JavaScript library such as jQuery.

### How to use it?:

Simply clone this project and replace your name in custom.js file where i have commented specifically which line to add. By default, My name is in there. You can change it to whatever you like.
