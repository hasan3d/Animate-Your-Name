# Animate Your Name

I wrote this JavaScript as a part of the project assigned by [Codecademy] (https://www.codecademy.com).
In order to accomplish this project I had to use JavaScript library such as jQuery, alphabet.js etc.

I have extended the original project and added some extra JavaScript with regular expressions. So, when a user click on the view project, it will prompt the user first and last name. If the user only enters his/her first or last name it will throw an error and ask  the user to enter a full name. I have written this program in a way that it will only accept a person's full name. If the person's full name is too long then they can enter their initials and surname.
